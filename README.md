# EVM From Scratch

![EVM From Scratch](.logo.png)

Welcome to Rajkumar's implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine in Rust.

## Note
1. Gas tracking hasn't been added yet.
2. It doesn't include Tload and TStore.
3. This project was for learning. I chose to implement an EVM in Rust to improve my Rust skills.

## Getting Started
The command below will run the EVM against the test cases in evm.json.
```
cargo run
```

## Credits
All the test cases in this repository were created by [w1nt3r.eth](https://twitter.com/w1nt3r_eth). The repository is part of the ["EVM From Scratch"](https://github.com/w1nt3r-eth/evm-from-scratch) course (release date TBD).
